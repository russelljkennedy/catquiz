# Which one of my cats are you?

Find out with this genuine, guaranteed personality calculator. I built this mostly to practice working with Vue, but it's been a lot of tail-twitching fun at the same time.

An array of quiz questions gets loaded in, then a function keeps track of answers before returning the most common value and assigning it to one of my cats.

Enjoy, and I hope you're pleased with your result!
